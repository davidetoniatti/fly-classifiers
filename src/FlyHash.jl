    FlyHash(X::AbstractMatrix, P::AbstractProjectionMatrix, k::Int) ->

Computes the FlyHash of each column of matrix `X`, using the projection matrix `P`.
For each column, the FlyHash is defined by the indices of the `k` largest
projections.

# Arguments
- `X::AbstractMatrix`: Input matrix (d x n).
- `P::AbstractProjectionMatrix`: Random projection matrix (m x d).
- `k::Int`: Number of nonzeros per column (the "top-k").

# Returns
- `SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int}`: The sparse FlyHash matrix (m x n).

"""
    _topk_indices!(top_idxs, top_vals, v, k) -> Vector{Int}

Finds the indices of the `k` largest values in a vector `v` and stores them in `top_idxs`.

This is an optimized, in-place function that avoids allocations by using pre-allocated
buffers. It maintains a buffer of the top `k` elements found so far. When it encounters
a new element larger than the current minimum in the buffer, it replaces that minimum
and then performs a linear scan of the small buffer to find the new minimum. This approach
is efficient for small `k`. In fact, it is much faster than partialsortperm!.

# Arguments
- `top_idxs::Vector{Int}`: A pre-allocated buffer of size `k` to store the resulting indices.
- `top_vals::Vector{T}`: A pre-allocated buffer of size `k` to store the corresponding values.
- `v::AbstractVector{T}`: The input vector to search for top elements.
- `k::Int`: The number of top elements to find.

# Returns
- `Vector{Int}`: The modified `top_idxs` buffer containing the indices of the top `k` values.
